Project Description

Revenue plays an important role in retail companies. Currently, with the high growth rate of online sales, forecasting sales becomes a key issue for retail companies, which allows them to properly make short term planning such as managing commodity classification, controlling stock quantity and so on.
This paper builds AR(p) model with linear regression to quantify influence of temperature, holiday and other indicators on sales, and predict weekly sales. First, we build a general model using average sales data for all stores. Based on that, we then select the best performing store and build a new forecast model for it.
By establishing models, we are able to give some suggestions for the company to predict sales and make short term plans such as managing commodity classification, controlling stock quantity and so on.
